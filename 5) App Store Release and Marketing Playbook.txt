App Store Release & Marketing Playbook (NEW)

Marketing asset pipeline:
Required screenshot set, device frames, captions
30s App Preview video storyboard + capture settings
Keyword set, subtitle tests, localized metadata plan
Press kit (icon set, logo, hero art, one‑pager, trailer)

Post‑launch ops:
Content update cadence
Feature flags/A‑B testing workflow
Community feedback intake → triage → roadmap
Hotfix path (severity levels, build/submit checklist)

UI & UX Design Workflow (Figma-Free Zone)
Primary Design Tool:
- Adobe Photoshop – sole environment for UI, HUD, menu layouts, buttons, icons, and App Store screenshot composition.
- Rationale: Native desktop speed, precise layer & pixel control, no browser latency, leverages 25+ years of design muscle memory.

Prototyping / Developer Handoff:
- Zeplin – accepts Photoshop exports, auto-generates pixel specs, asset slices, and clickable flows for developers.
- Rationale: Handles collaboration & export without forcing work inside a cloud editor. Keeps design decisions in Photoshop.

Optional Marketing Asset Tools:
- Canva Pro (optional) – for rapid marketing boards or social media graphics when Photoshop isn’t necessary.
- Affinity Publisher (optional) – for laying out large multi-screenshot App Store sets or press kits with precise typography.

Pipeline Notes:
1. All UI assets are authored in Photoshop, layered and grouped for easy export.
2. Export to Zeplin via plugin for developer access.
3. Prototyping is limited to clickable flows — no animation mockups are required unless specifically scoped.
4. Marketing assets may be adapted into Canva or Publisher, but design direction remains in Photoshop.
5. No Figma or browser-based design tools are used at any stage — prevents performance loss, UI lag, and tool overhead.

Pass Apple Without Losing the Joke – Submission Checklist:
Framing & Tone:
- Target satire at behaviors/archetypes, never entire nationalities or demographics.
- Depict vices with comedic consequences (hangovers, debuffs) rather than glorification.
- Keep art/cartoon tone light and avoid realistic depictions of vice.

In-Game Content:
- Balance humor with positive/neutral moments so satire isn't 100% negative.
- Use "Travel Bro" archetype language rather than implying all locals share traits.
- Include comedic failure states to frame vices as flaws.

App Store Metadata:
- Avoid loaded terms in title, subtitle, or keywords that could be misread as offensive.
- Use whimsical, playful tone in description (EarthBound meets European vacation parody).
- Do not mention alcohol/weed directly in the first two lines of description.

Screenshots & Preview:
- Show colorful, cartoonish visuals over gritty or realistic vice depictions.
- Include NPCs, humor moments, and silly items to convey lighthearted tone.
- Avoid sexualized imagery or anything that could be construed as targeting minors.

Review Process Prep:
- Run European playtest and document positive reception to satire.
- Prepare alternate copy/screenshots that tone down satire for resubmission if initially rejected.
