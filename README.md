# EuroBound

**EuroBound** is a retro-inspired mobile JRPG built in the spirit of EarthBound with a sharply satirical twist. Players control a trio of washed-up frat bros—Lord Pilsner, Chadwick, and Bradley—on a final bender across Europe as they attempt to reclaim their youth one terrible decision at a time.

## 📍 Core Features
- Front-view, turn-based combat with rolling HP meter and absurd status effects
- Three unique parody cities: Publandia (Dublin), Debaucheryville (Prague), Sinfonia (Vienna)
- Visible overworld encounters, ICQ-style save/chat terminals, NFT sidequests
- Deep narrative systems and world state persistence
- Built for mobile: one-handed UX, high-contrast modes, fluid microinteractions

## 🧠 Structure
See `GAMEPLAN.md` for detailed folder breakdown and development roadmap.

## 🎯 Project Goals
Create a mobile-first, narrative-rich RPG that delivers on humor, design, and accessibility.

## 🚧 Current Status
Planning & pre-production phase — full design doc structure being migrated to markdown.
