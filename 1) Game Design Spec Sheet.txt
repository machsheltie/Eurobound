1) Game Design Spec Sheet – “Eurobound”

Core Concept
• Content line: suggestive humor and seedy underbelly themes; no explicit nudity.

Game Loop
Explore overworld → Trigger visible encounters → EarthBound-style battle → Earn EXP, items, gear → City boss → Story advancement + new skills → Optional sidequests (NFT scavenger, Wi‑Fi/ICQ chats) → Next city

Core Systems Snapshot
• Stats: HP (rolling), SP (skills), Offense, Defense, Speed, Charm, Luck, Grit (crit resist)
• Status Effects: Hungover (-Offense, -Speed), Grease Fingers (-Accuracy), Embarrassed (-Offense, disables Taunt), Thirsty (regen halved), Inspired (+Charm/+Crit)
• Gear Slots: Weapon, Shirt, Pants, Shoes (+ optional Trinket)
• Encounters: visible enemies; preemptive/back attacks; auto‑win vs. very weak foes
• Items/Skills (examples): Electrolyte Pack, Charcoal Tabs, Iced Coffee, Roast Line, Look of Disgust, Glow‑Up Aura

Main Playable Party
Lord Pilsner – The overconfident yet lovable “leader” of the group.
Class: Brew Knight
Signature Weapon: Custom stein-shaped mace (doubles as a mug in cutscenes).
Battle Style: Balanced — mixes physical blows with morale-boosting “toasts” that buff allies.
Quirks: Always insists on ordering “the local specialty” no matter how questionable it looks; has an encyclopedic but often completely inaccurate “knowledge” of European history.
Running Gag: Constantly mistakes key plot details, leading to side quests that are either disasters or surprising wins.

Chadwick – The “strategist” who thinks being the loudest makes him the smartest.
Class: Influencer Bard
Signature Weapon: Wireless selfie stick with retractable microphone.
Battle Style: Support/Debuff — can charm NPCs, lower enemy morale, or livestream fights to gain in-game currency.
Quirks: Keeps stopping mid-combat for “content”; rates every city’s nightlife out of 10, with absurdly shifting criteria.
Running Gag: His livestream followers often leave unhelpful or sarcastic “tips” in ICQ chats during missions.

Bradley – The muscle of the group, with a surprisingly sensitive side.
Class: Bro Barbarian
Signature Weapon: Foldable beer-pong table used like a greatshield.
Battle Style: Heavy melee damage with occasional crowd-control moves (“Keg Toss” stuns multiple enemies).
Quirks: Always looking for the nearest gym or spa; refuses to fight without his “pump-up playlist.”
Running Gag: Frequently distracted by gym-related sidequests or flexing competitions with NPCs.

Party Dynamics & Humor
All three can be switched in/out during battle, each with unique overworld abilities (Lord Pilsner can “negotiate” with bar owners, Chadwick can unlock secret social events, Bradley can break obstacles or intimidate shady NPCs).
Dialog is written in a mix of frat-bro banter and exaggerated “epic hero” narration, with the game clearly playing up the contrast.
Their loyalty is genuine — even if their adventures constantly spiral into absurd side quests.

### 🎪 The Cirque du Shady

**City:** Debaucheryville

**Tone:** Earthbound-style circus sprites, but with darker, satirical underbelly humor.

**Main Attractions & NPCs:**

Features:
Hamstradamus’ Tent – Special appearance for prophecy delivery.
Rigged carnival games with joke prizes (e.g., “Half-Smoked Cigar,” “Used Glitter Hat”).
Side characters selling suspicious “mystery meat” corndogs.
Occasional pop-up events where a Darkweb Dossier character appears “in disguise” as a circus performer.

Global Side Quests and Gags
(All designed to be tongue-in-cheek, culturally specific, and “retro JRPG silly”)
1. The Great Döner Debate (Publandia & Debaucheryville crossover)
NPCs in different cities insist their late-night kebab/döner/kebab-box is the “only real” one.
If you taste-test all variants and give your verdict, you get a “World’s Pickiest Drunk” badge.

2. The Couchsurfing Chronicles
Optional interiors where the bros “crash” with NPCs met in bars.
Player must navigate awkward morning-after conversations to get stat boosts (Charisma) or hilariously bad debuffs (Hangover).

3. Vinyl Hunt
NPC music snobs drop cryptic clues to rare LPs hidden in each world’s seedier corners.
Collecting them unlocks a battle track remix for the soundtrack (meta reward).

4. Underground Karaoke League (Sinfonia)
Certain interiors have karaoke battles against increasingly absurd opponents (opera singers, drunk businessmen, tone-deaf tourists).
Win for rare items (“Golden Mic” = +5 charisma).

5. Public Restroom Graffiti Quest
Hidden bathrooms have crude/funny graffiti that act as mini lore drops or point to treasure.
Collect all to get the “Street Philosopher” title.

6. Meme Black Market (Debaucheryville)
NPC sells rare in-game memes for in-game currency, some of which are useless but hilarious in battle (summon “Shiba Hype” for morale boost).

7. The Street Performer Trials
Scattered across all cities are “boss-lite” encounters with buskers/mimes/magicians that must be outperformed or outwitted.
Each victory adds a comedy prop to Lord Pilsner’s inventory.

8. Selfie with a Local Legend
Certain NPCs are mock versions of famous local figures (e.g., “Maestro Beerschi” in Sinfonia).
Taking selfies with all of them unlocks a “Tourist Flex” bonus to NPC interactions.

9. Taxi Driver Confessionals
Random taxi rides trigger procedurally generated absurd confessions from the driver.
Hearing them all gives you the “All the Tea” lore achievement.

10. The Wi-Fi Roulette Game
At any free Wi-Fi hotspot, the ICQ chat could give helpful hints… or lead to strange sidequests like delivering “urgent” drunk texts for strangers.

Darkweb Dossier Crossover Events
At various points in the game, your party will encounter bizarre, intrusive “communications” from characters out of the Darkweb Dossier universe. These appear primarily via ICQ pop-ups triggered at specific Free Wi-Fi hotspots scattered across the cities.

Mechanics:
Wi-Fi hotspots are marked by an obvious “FREE Wi-Fi” sign outside cafés, bars, and random suspicious storefronts.
Interacting prompts Lord Pilsner to whip out his outdated phone, loading a pixelated ICQ chat interface.
Instead of friendly NPC banter, the connection is “hijacked” by one of the following recurring personalities:

Tony420 – Greasy cyber-dealer offering absurd illicit wares.
Example pop-up: Tony420: "$30 Xanax & Flintstone fentanyl. Message me for my crypto wallet deetz."
Replies include sarcastic brush-offs or gullible acceptance (leads to a gag inventory item like “Fentanyl-Flavored Flintstones Gummies – Non-Edible”).

Hamstradamus – A prophetic dancing hamster with cursed Y2K prophecies.
Example pop-up: Hamstradamus: "REPENT BEFORE THE CLOCK TICKS 00:00 OR YOUR NOKIA SHALL BECOME A TOASTER."
Occasionally references upcoming events in-game in cryptic nonsense form.

CryptoBro69 – An obnoxious pump-and-dump evangelist.
Example pop-up: CryptoBro69: "YOU GOTTA GET IN ON MY PIXELATED KEBAB MONKEY NFT – NEXT STOP, MOON!"
Will shill absurd NFTs that tie directly into the frat bro sidequest.
These pop-ups don’t alter the main plot but add satirical flavor, player choice reactions, and occasional gag inventory items.

Frat Bro NFT Sidequest
Lord Pilsner’s two traveling companions, Chadwick and Bradley, are convinced the secret to legendary hero status is collecting the "Ultimate Brochain NFT Collection" scattered across Europe.

Acquisition Methods:
QR Murals: Graffiti-style street art in back alleys; scanning reveals a garish NFT.
Shady Terminals: Coin-operated kiosks with CRT monitors and sticky keyboards.
Rigged Mini-Games: Win (or intentionally lose) suspicious arcade challenges to “earn” your NFT.
Influencer Syndicate Theft: Occasionally, members of the Influencer Syndicate (smug TikTok travel vloggers with a suspicious number of sponsored posts) will be flaunting an NFT. Defeat them in absurd mini-games or side quests to swipe it.

Examples of NFTs:
Pixelated Kebab Monkey – Dubiously hand-drawn in MS Paint.
Beer Pong Saint Relic – An 8-bit halo hovering over a red solo cup.
Meme Lord’s First Selfie – Clearly a stolen MySpace photo.

Rewards for Collection Milestones:
3 NFTs: Cosmetic badge displayed on Lord Pilsner’s inventory screen (purely for bragging rights).
6 NFTs: “Wallet of Shame” trinket — a tiny charm granting a small Charisma boost (+1 Charm) but forever marking you as that guy.
9 NFTs: Secret epilogue gag scene where Chadwick & Bradley hold a champagne-fueled press conference as Crypto Kings of Europe… seconds before the market crashes, bankrupting them instantly.

Satire Angle:
NFTs are intentionally ugly, low-res, and paired with ridiculous “lore” explaining their supposed value.
Dialogue pokes fun at crypto hype, get-rich-quick schemes, and frat bro FOMO culture.
Hidden references tie into other Easter eggs across the game, including Darkweb Dossier ICQ pop-ups and bulletin board posters.Wi‑Fi Hotspots & ICQ Chats (Save + Flavor + Hint System)
• Clearly signed “FREE Wi‑Fi” locations double as save points and optional chat scenes.
• ICQ contacts: Mom, Bestie, Hot Kroger Guy (cameo), Random Forum Troll, Shadow Tipster.
• Uses: save, receive rumor-hints, unlock small healing or SP once per hotspot, drip‑feed world lore.
• Accessibility: toggle chat speed; long-press to fast‑scroll.
Progression & Rewards
• City completion grants unique trinkets and unlocks cosmetic palettes.
• Street Rep: optional meter raised by witty choices; unlocks discounts and unique dialogue.

Bulletin Board Crossover System
Borrowing from Earthbound’s bulletin board mechanic, pixelated posters can be found in cities, bars, and random walls.
Location: Scattered throughout all cities, typically in public hubs, side alleys, or near quest areas.
Interaction: Player can press the interact button to read the board. Interacting with a poster displays its full ad text in a pop-up window.
Content Types:
Pixel Posters — Stylized, in-world versions of satirical campaigns (e.g., Got Soap? ads).
Lore Notes — Comedic notices that hint at local rumors, mini-quests, or poke fun at NPCs.
Running Gags — Cross-game callbacks from other Stacey projects.
Reward System: Optional — reading all boards in a city could grant an achievement or unlock a cosmetic (e.g., “Poster Collector” title).
Tone: Retro RPG absurdity meets social satire, in the spirit of Earthbound’s quirky humor.

Player Experience Goals (Mobile‑first)
• Thumb‑friendly: 48pt tap targets; bottom‑corner controls; safe‑area aware.
• Microinteractions: button bounce (120ms), hit sparks (12–20 particles), SMAAAASH banner + brief shake, rolling HP tween (1–2s).
• Readability: bitmap fonts at 2–3× scale; clear status icons; short quips over walls of text.
Content Guidelines
• No explicit nudity. Innuendo only, played for humor. 
• Seedy underbelly portrayed via suggestions, satire, and mechanics (VIP access, backrooms, rumors, rigged games). 
• Lighthearted, punch‑up tone; avoid degrading real populations or identities.
Humor-forward writing, with each battle encounter dripping with personality.

Game Structure:
Mechanics:
Combat: Front-view, menu-driven, rolling HP meter, SMAAAASH crits, visible status effects.
Stats: HP, SP, Offense, Defense, Speed, Charm, Luck, Grit (crit resist).
