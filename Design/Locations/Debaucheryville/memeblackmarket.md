Meme Black Market
City: Debaucheryville
Location Type: Hidden Vendor + Sidequest

Theme & Vibe:
Flickering CRT glow bounces off Funcoland bags and corrupted gifs
The smell of hot pockets and old carpet burns your soul just by walking on it
A Nokia ringtone loops faintly from somewhere deep within the ducts
ASCII cats peer down from the ductwork like cursed guardians 
Glitchy AIM away messages plaster the walls like cursed devotional icons
A desktop PC endlessly crashes into the Windows 98 startup chime

Vendor: MemeLord.exe
Former ICQ meme channel mod, now rogue archivist and "meme economist"
Half-human, half-Adobe Flash runtime
Bleached tips, Guy Fieri visor, fingerless gloves, vapes exclusively Baja Blast mist
Speaks only in broken Internet slang and stolen AIM away messages.

Catchphrases:
(Delivered with the dramatic gravitas of someone who thinks these are sacred texts)
“Warning: I run on LimeWire and vengeance.”
“Hamster Dance is eternal, peasant.”
“My soul is encoded in Winamp skins and guilt.”
“Funcoland offered me $1.10 for my soul and two PS2 controllers.”
“I once hosted 12 gifs on Angelfire—simultaneously.”
“Wanna buy a rage comic that got me banned from Habbo Hotel?”
“YOLO’d into GeoCitiesCoin, AMA.”
“I got diamond hands and zero liquidity, baby.”
