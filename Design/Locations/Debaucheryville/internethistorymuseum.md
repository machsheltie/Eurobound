Internet History Museum
Location Type: Faux Museum / Hidden Access Hub
Location: Debaucheryville – Former Blockbuster (now draped in printer paper banners)

📺 Visuals:
A glitching banner scrolls “PRESERVING OUR DIGITAL PAST” in Comic Sans above a doorway patched with broken jewel cases. Inside, decades-old CRT monitors flicker with vaporwave screensavers. Dust motes dance in the warm buzz of static. QR codes hang like ancient scrolls. A Chuck E. Cheese animatronic stares blankly from a defunct Furbies exhibit.

🏚️ Exterior:
Still vaguely Blockbuster-shaped, but now boarded up with floppy disks and wrapped in caution tape marked “AOL USERS ONLY.” A dead PalmPilot hangs like a security camera. Graffiti reads “ZOMG LOL WTF M8?” above the entrance. Pigeons nest atop a sagging 404 Error sign.

💻 Interior:
An eerie blend of forgotten tech and misremembered childhood:
Hall of Modems: A shrine of dial-up relics emits cursed screeching if approached.
GeoCities Diorama: Complete with twinkling GIF stars and embedded MIDI soundtracks that won’t stop.
Angelfire Wall of Flames: Still loading since 2002.
Habbo Hotel Crime Scene: A velvet rope surrounds a yellow smiley with a knife.
The MSN Messenger Graveyard: Lit by flickering green lights and broken webcams.
Darkroom Exhibit: A cracked iMac G3 on an altar with incense and a stack of burned CDs labeled “DO NOT OPEN.”

🧠 Theme & Vibe:
Nostalgia weaponized and left to rot. The museum is less an archive and more a hallucination of what Gen X and elder millennials think the internet used to be. It’s equal parts fever dream and malware cache, humming with ghost pings and unresolved trauma from LimeWire downloads gone wrong.
Visitors feel like they’ve stepped into a cursed yearbook for every regrettable digital moment between 1995 and 2007.

🧩 Gameplay Use:
ICQ Event Hub:

💻 Type “AllYourBase69” at the cracked MSN Messenger terminal
🔓 Hidden door slides open to reveal MemeLord.exe’s den.

Meme Lore Unlocks:
Interacting with defunct terminals may trigger embarrassing Lord Pilsner backstory cutscenes.

Buff or Status Effects:
Interacting with the MIDI Archive can apply either “Cringe” or “Inspired” at random.
Viewing the Habbo Hotel Crime Scene while drunk grants a temporary “Pixel PTSD” debuff (screen shakes during dialogue).

📛 Curator of the Cursed Web

“You’ve Got Mail!”
WinXP startup chime slowed to a menacing crawl
