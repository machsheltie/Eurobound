Velvet Curtain Club
Location Type: Seedy Elite Nightclub
Location: Dead-end service lane behind the opera ruins—past the graffiti dumpster mural and velvet-rope checkpoint.

Visuals: Burgundy fog, crushed-velvet drapery, vape-pen crystal chandeliers, gold trim, underlit booths, neon aphorisms pulsing to the bass.

Exterior:
Hidden entrance down a graffiti-laced alley tucked behind an opera house ruins billboard.
Guarded by a bouncer with glowing cybernetic eyes and a sign that reads:
“✨ Vibes Only. No Shoes? No Dignity? You’re In.”
Heavy velvet curtain as the only door, subtly pulsating with music bass.

Interior Visuals:
Deep burgundy lighting and fog, chandeliers made of crushed vape pens and crystal teardrops.
Gold-plated stripper poles serve as coat racks.
Neon signs flicker with cryptic phrases like:
“The Real Party’s in Your Head”
Booths are semicircular, crushed velvet, lit from underneath with flickering LEDs.
A DJ plays glitchy lounge-techno remixes from a dais shaped like a broken throne.

Theme & Vibe:
Retro-luxury meets decaying glamor — think Studio 54 meets Eastern Bloc goth.
A love letter to bad decisions made under chandeliers.

Patrons:
Age range: mid-20s to 40s, but everyone insists they’re 22.
Wearing a mix of ravewear, thrifted opera cloaks, and NFT logo crop tops.
NPC dialogue includes gems like:
“He said he was a ‘sound alchemist.’ I think that means DJ.”
“I only drink cocktails made with rare emotional damage.”

Gameplay Use:
Meet Vape Witch Vanessa here.
Unlock side event: “Influencer Blood Ritual” (fake goth influencer attempts to summon more followers via absinthe).
Entry requires at least +1 Charisma or bribing the bouncer with an expired concert wristband.

NFT Hunt Tie-in:
Enter the bathroom, search the stalls, and scan the QR graffiti in the middle stall to find the  “Pixelated Kebab Monkey” NFT.S
