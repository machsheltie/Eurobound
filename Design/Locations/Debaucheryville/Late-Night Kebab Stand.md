Late-Night Kebab Stand
Location Type: Consumable Vendor (Grease-Cure Items)
Location: Debaucheryville – near the Velvet Curtain Club alley exit

Visuals:
A blinding fluorescent-lit food cart wedged between a chain-link fence and a wall scrawled with “NFT 4 LYFE.” Layers of meat spin languidly on a rusty vertical rotisserie.
Grease puddles shimmer rainbow in the gutter. Empty Red Bull cans and crumpled condom wrappers decorate the sidewalk like confetti. An overturned rave flyer flaps against a crate.
Steam and cigarette smoke hang thick in the cold air. A rat casually gnaws on a rogue chili pepper near the curb.

Sign:
“MR. CHADZ KEBABS”
The Meat You Regret Tomorrow™
Hand-painted in crooked faux-Arabic font, backlit by a flickering LED strip zip-tied to a hookah hose.

Theme & Vibe:
Greasy, gloriously sketchy
Post-party lifeline for blackout characters
The spiritual equivalent of an edible walk of shame
A symphony of salt, shame, and mystery meat

Vendor:
Mr. Chadz
A bouncer-turned-kebabist. 6’4”, wears a glittery crop top over a bulletproof vest. Runs the stand with one hand while monitoring a burner phone filled with crypto alerts.
Catchphrases:
“I call this one 'intestinal roulette.' You want two?”
“The FDA stopped returning my emails in 2019.”
“Meat’s mostly legal. Heat lamp’s all vibes.”
