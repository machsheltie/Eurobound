Velvet Curtain Club – VIP Stall
Location Type: Restroom
Location: Debaucheryville – Velvet Curtain Club – Behind curtain labeled “Staff Only”

Visuals:
Marble-look tile with gold flake… that’s actually just glitter Mod Podge
Subtle ambient glow from a ceiling fixture shaped like a champagne flute
Wall graffiti includes scribbled startup ideas, @ handles, and questionable altcoin pump schemes
Entire scene bathes in looping RGB LED shimmer, flickering erratically to bass drops
Room warps slightly when drunk — text on graffiti drips champagne visually (bubble particle overlay)

Exterior:
Hidden behind a red velvet curtain marked “STAFF ONLY” in cracked embroidery
Flanked by two buffed-out bouncers who ignore you unless Bravado stat is high enough
Faux-brass plaque nearby reads:
“VIP Stall generously sponsored by Tech Bros Who Can’t Hold Their Liquor”
Trail of glitter, lip gloss, and expired wristbands leads subtly toward entry

Interior:
Compact stall with a black velvet-lined seat — deeply stained, impossibly plush
Wall-mounted champagne holder (chipped) with a half-empty bottle of Moët 2003: Spite Reserve
Overhead mirror is a live selfie-cam that flashes your face with a filter labeled “#CryptoQueen”
One cracked tile peels back, revealing a QR code for NFT #2

Graffiti glows faintly with phrases like:
“ROI = Regret On Investment”
“I BLEW IT… literally”
“Buy Low, Cry High”
A QR code reads:
“Scan for Velvet DAO Invite (Not a Scam, Probably)”

Theme and Vibe:
Hyper-exclusive regret meets toilet-papered luxury
Feels like a shrine to everyone who peaked during the 2017 bull run
A place where one-night stands and tech startups were both born and died
You’re either too sober to belong or too drunk to notice it’s a scam
