Location: Shadowed alley near the Shadow Exchange (requires +1 Bravado to enter)

Visuals: Gritty dive with flickering chandelier made of empty mini-kegs. Moldy leather booths.

Exterior:
Hidden in a shadowed alley near the Shadow Exchange.
Backlit sign of three rusting crowns over a beer stein.
Floor outside is sticky, smells of boiled cabbage and beer.

Interior Visuals:
Chandeliers made of mini-kegs, booths patched with gaffer tape and hope.
Mismatched furniture, peeling walls, "art" drawn in mustard.
Hazy orange lighting from wall sconces shaped like beer foam.

Theme & Vibe:
Slavic-style triple-ferment brews served in antique goblets.
Gritty, medieval Slavic dive bar reimagined by someone who failed architecture.
Feels like a 300-year-old castle turned into a frat basement.

“The smell hits you first: sweat, sour hops, and a whiff of something legally inadvisable.”
Obstacle: Stealth puzzle — sneak past passed-out patrons and floor creaks. Stepping on wrong tiles wakes a bouncer miniboss.

Patrons:
Tanked nobles in tracksuits, shouting drinking songs with zero rhythm.
NPCs are slurry and aggressive:
“We invented beer before hygiene — priorities!”
