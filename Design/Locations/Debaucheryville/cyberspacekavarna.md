# Cyberspace Kavarna

**Name:** Cyberspace Kavarna  
**Location Type:** Seedy 24-Hour Internet Den  
**Location:** Basement level beneath Hostel Row, accessed via a staircase marked with a flickering "INTERNET" neon sign and Cyrillic graffiti.

**Visuals:** Smoke-stained CRT monitors glowing green, tangled ethernet cables, stained coffee cups, cigarette burn holes in Soviet-era furniture, walls lined with bootleg movie posters and crypto mining rigs.

---

## **Exterior:**
- **Narrow staircase** descending from Hostel Row street level
- **Flickering neon sign:** "INTERNET" in English with "KAVARNA" in smaller Cyrillic letters below
- **Posted warnings** in multiple languages: "NO TORRENTING," "CASH ONLY," "YOUR DATA IS NOT SAFE"
- **Constant hum** of overworked ventilation trying to clear cigarette smoke and desperation

---

## **Interior Visuals:**
- **Maze of CRT monitors** on mismatched desks, half showing Windows 98 blue screens
- **Ethernet cables** snaking across the floor like digital ivy, duct-taped to walls
- **Coffee-stained Soviet-era furniture:** mismatched chairs, wobbly tables, ashtrays overflowing
- **Walls covered with:** bootleg movie posters, crypto mining rigs humming ominously, ICQ contact lists printed and taped up
- **Lighting:** Harsh fluorescent strips mixed with monitor glow, creating a sickly green pallor
- **Air quality:** Thick with cigarette smoke, instant coffee steam, and the ozone smell of overheating electronics

---

## **Theme & Vibe:**
**Eastern Bloc internet culture meets Y2K digital underground.** Think Matrix-wannabe aesthetic run by people who learned computers from bootleg CDs. It's where digital dreams come to die slowly, one dial-up connection at a time.

**The perfect storm of:** expired technology, questionable legality, and American tourists who think connecting here makes them "underground hackers."

**NPC Dialogue gems:**

## **Enhanced Bro Dialogue - Hackers Movie References:**

### **Upon Entering Cyberspace Kavarna:**
- **Pilsner:** *"Gentlemen, welcome to the real world. This is like that Hackers movie!"*
- **Chadwick:** *"Bro, we're totally going to 'hack the planet!' Just like Angelina Jolie!"*
- **Bradley:** *"Dude, should we be worried about 'The Plague'? I don't want to crash any garbage files."*

### **While Using Terminals:**
- **Chadwick:** *"I'm in! Wait, how do I get past this login screen? Where's the 3D interface?"*
- **Pilsner:** *"Zero Cool would know what to do here. We need to think like elite hackers!"*
- **Bradley:** *"Why doesn't this look like the movie? Where are all the flying icons?"*

### **During ICQ Sessions:**
- **Pilsner:** *"This must be how they communicate in the underground. We're like Crash Override!"*
- **Chadwick:** *"Bro, we should get hacker names! I'll be... 'Lord Viral'!"*
- **Bradley:** *"Are we supposed to wear leather pants? That chick in the movie had leather pants."*

### **When Scammers Contact Them:**
- **Chadwick:** *"Guys, this might be 'The Plague' trying to social engineer us!"*
- **Pilsner:** *"Stay alert, gentlemen. This could be a Gibson trying to frame us!"*
- **Bradley:** *"Should we say 'mess with the best, die like the rest'? Is that the protocol?"*

- **Bradley:** *"That was way easier than the movie made it look. We're natural hackers!"*

### **Reality Check:**
- **Every "secure" transaction** gets immediately posted to a public forum
- **"Anonymous" browsing** includes mandatory user registration with passport scan
- **"Underground" location** is literally listed on TripAdvisor as "authentic Czech internet experience"

### **Cultural Disconnect:**
- **Bros think:** They're accessing the darkweb underground
- **Reality:** They're using public terminals in a tourist-targeted internet cafe
- **Result:** Perfect marks for every scammer within a 50-mile radius

## **The Beautiful Irony:**

The bros come here thinking they're **"going underground"** and **"connecting with authentic Eastern European digital culture,"** when really they're just:

1. **Paying tourist prices** for terrible internet
2. **Broadcasting their location** to every scammer in Prague  
3. **Using computers** that haven't been updated since Windows XP
4. **Breathing secondhand smoke** while thinking it's "atmospheric"
5. **Getting targeted** by the exact people this place was designed to attract: clueless American tourists with money to lose

**Perfect venue for them to feel "edgy" while being the most obvious targets in the entire establishment.**
