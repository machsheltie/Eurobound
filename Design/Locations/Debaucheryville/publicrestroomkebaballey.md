Public Restroom – “Grease Trap Shrine”
Location Type: Restroom
Location: Debaucheryville – Kebab Alley – Behind Grease Vendor Tent

Visuals:
Sickly orange glow from a backlit “Open Late” sign repurposed as a shrine light
Steam rises from nearby fryer exhaust vents and mixes with fog that smells faintly of cumin and despair
Walls shimmer with a layer of airborne fat, like a protective glaze
Everything pulses faintly under neon kebab signage flicker

Exterior:
Obscured behind a grease-stained vinyl tent flap with a hand-scrawled sign:
“NOT A TOILET (unless desperate)”
Accessed through a crawlspace only usable at 3AM in-game time
Empty skewer boxes and fly-buzzing pickle barrels stacked nearby
Fistø’s tag glows faintly on the back wall:
“Puked here in ‘99. Came back to visit it like it’s Mecca.”

Interior:
Walls coated in glistening grease film, reflecting player movement like oily shadows
Toilet paper roll is a crumpled kebab receipt from “Mr. Chadz Kebab” dated 2004, still warm
Flickering fluorescent bulb dangles from a meat skewer stabbed into the ceiling tile
Sink basin contains three things: one cursed coin, a half-chewed antacid, and a kebab napkin folded into a swan
Cracked mirror above the urinal loops cryptic QR codes and eldritch meat glyphs
(One glyph vaguely resembles a Sheltie wearing a paper crown)

Optional environmental detail: Stall graffiti spells out a haiku:
Grease beneath my feet /
Secrets marinate in heat /
I pray. Then I leak.

Theme and Vibe:
Urban legend meets gastrointestinal pilgrimage
A sacred site for those who worship bad decisions, 4AM meat, and bodily resilience
Feels like a place where reality was thin for a moment and someone made a wish on a gyro
Half-shrine, half-biohazard, all ambiance
