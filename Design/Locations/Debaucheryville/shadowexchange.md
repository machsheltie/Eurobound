Shadow Exchange
Location Type: Underground Money Changer & Black‑Market Bazaar
Location: Sub‑basement beneath Old Town backstreets; accessed via a loose cobblestone that reveals worn stairs and a “cash-only” candle off a narrow back-alley behind the market square.

Visuals: Vaulted stone arches, clacking split-flap rate board, iron-lattice stalls, UV money-check shimmer, CRT ticker glow, blue-grey smoke.

Exterior:
A narrow, damp alley with a crooked sign: “SHΔDOW EXCHΔNGE — Best Rates If You Don’t Ask.”
Hidden stone step triggers a hinge: the cobblestone lifts, revealing a stairwell lit by cigarette‑burned tealights.
Faint ticker‑click sound and shuffling whispers drift up with cold air that smells like copper, old wine, and photocopier toner.

Interior Visuals:
Vaulted wine‑cellar arches repurposed into stalls; iron lattice dividers hung with counterfeit handbags and deactivated security tags.
A rate board of split‑flap letters clacks every few seconds, updating exchange rates and “broker mood.”
Wooden counters inlaid with scratched glass; under each pane sits a tray of odd currencies (coins, transit cards, casino chips, arcade tokens).
A back wall of CRT monitors shows pixelized “live markets”: kebab prices, nightclub cover charges, and meme‑coin candles rising and crashing.
A single desk lamp illuminates a ledger bound in duct tape (ties into the NFT hunt clue trail).

Theme & Vibe:
“Old‑world bank vault meets post‑Soviet flea market.”
Everything feels officially unofficial: stamped paperwork that doesn’t match, receipts with three different logos, clerks with too many calculators.
The soundscape: clacking split‑flaps, whispered haggling, cash counters whirring, a bored guard’s radio playing muzak at 2% volume.

Patrons:
Rate Sharks: grey‑coated fixers with nicotine fingers and immaculate ledgers.
Expat Flippers: buying/selling travel cards, concert wristbands, and unused museum tickets.
Counterfeit Connoisseurs: testing bills under UV wands like sommeliers swirling a glass.
Influencer Resellers: hawking “limited” VIP wristbands that mysteriously say WEDNESDAY no matter the day.

Overheard lines:
“Today I pay you in trust; tomorrow we settle in interest.”
“Exchange rate? Depends how loudly you asked.”
“NFTs are just zoo animals with bank accounts, darling.”

Gameplay Use:
Currency Conversion (Shifting Rates):
Interact with the split‑flap rate board for a micro‑minigame. On “green ticks,” rates improve; on “red ticks,” they worsen.
Street Rep or Charm can nudge the board (small, temporary rate bump).

Barter Window:
Trade non‑currency stuff (concert wristbands, metro day‑passes, gag items) for rare gear, consumables, or forged vouchers.
Some trades require identifying a counterfeit via a quick UV‑scan timing check.

Shady Contracts (Black‑Market Transactions):
“Buy a favor”: pay to reduce an area’s enemy aggro for 10 minutes.
“Sell your dignity”: exchange Embarrassed status for a one‑time rate boost (satirical barter with your pride).

Premium Stock (Locked):
After defeating Count Velvet Absinthe (Debaucheryville boss), a hidden gate opens at the back counter.
Premium list appears: Saint of Low Sodium Medal (alt source), Velvet Rope Clip (duplicate for build crafting), Forged Duty‑Free Receipt (+shop discounts in one area).

NFT Hunt Tie‑In:
The duct‑tape Shadow Ledger can be inspected to obtain the “VIP Wristband PNG” NFT if you’ve started the NFT sidequest.

Risk/Reward Meter:
Each transaction slightly raises or lowers Notoriety here; hit a threshold and the clerk will demand a “verification fee” (gold or an item) before further trades.

Couchsurfing Chronicles Hook — “CryptoBro69’s Ex”:
Where You Meet Her: In front of the main counter, mid‑scream at a vendor about “slippage fees.”
Morning Scene (after accepting her “you’re better looking than him, but dumber” invite):
You wake on a futon under buzzing CRTs and blister‑pack LED strips. She’s gone.
Result: Gain NFT #2: Pixelated Kebab Monkey (scratched); apply Hungover; –25 gold (your last cab voucher is missing).
Satire beat: The NFT’s metadata reads “MINTED: 03:17 AM — GAS FEE: ‘Don’t Worry About It.’”

Vendors & Sample Stock (flavor + hooks):
Clerk “Mrs. Rata”: “Cash speaks. Whining does not.” Sells Grease‑Proof Napkins, Electrolyte Packs, Forged Wristband (area access).
The UV Man: Will test your items for a fee; occasionally sells a Pocket UV Wand (tool item enabling counterfeit checks elsewhere).
Token Goblin: Buys/sells arcade tokens, transit cards, and Tap Dat Vault queue‑skip chips (single use, midnight only).
