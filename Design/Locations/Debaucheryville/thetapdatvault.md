3. The Tap Dat Vault
Location Type: Cyberpunk Brew Basement
Location: Clocktower Plaza — hidden switch opens cellar door at exactly midnight

Visuals: Cyberpunk basement with neon tubing, “brewing vats” that look suspiciously like chemistry lab gear.

Exterior:
Found under the Clocktower Plaza via a hidden switch — only opens at midnight.
Large metal vault door marked with neon graffiti and countdown glyphs.
Faint thumping bass pulses from within.

Interior Visuals:
Neon piping, backlit fermentation chambers with suspicious circuitry.
Brewing vats double as subwoofers.
Walls flicker like RGB wallpaper during a software crash.

Theme & Vibe:
Experimental vapor-brewed lagers (served in vape clouds).
Feels like a nightclub rendered by a GPU having a breakdown.
Cloudy vapor everywhere. Everything is rhythm-reactive: lights, steam, NPC movement.

Intro Scene (Cutscene Text):
“A bass drop echoes as the vault creaks open. You step into what feels like a nightclub inside a GPU.”
Obstacle: Rhythm-based puzzle syncing to glitchy techno track — press buttons to maintain the flow of beer vapor pressure.

Patrons:
DJ zombies, vape-huffing techno monks, one guy livestreaming from inside a fridge.
They speak in glitching sentence fragments:
“Brew… lag… inhale th-the vibe… ✨limited edition fizzpack✨”

Name: Glitched Brew Ad Bot
