24-Hour Internet Café – Back Room Concessions
Location Type: Concession Stand
Location: Debaucheryville – 24 Hour Internet Café – Back Room

🎮 Visuals:
Dim fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting sickly hues on mismatched office chairs and retro CRT monitors displaying endless pop-up ads. A laminated “Hot Pockets + Protocols” combo menu peels from the wall. The concession booth is wedged between two gutted vending machines—one stuffed with thermal paste, the other flickering like it knows your secrets.

🔐 Access:
Only available after reading a graffiti clue in the front café restroom stall.
Clue: "Got beef with reality? Ctrl+Alt+Meat."

🎪 Sign:
"404: Calories Not Found"
Backlit by a hacked neon server rack.

🤡 Theme & Vibe:
Digital depravity meets greasy gamer fuel. This is the kind of place where you eat meat cubes with plastic forks while torrenting conspiracy documentaries. The lingering scent of instant noodles, sweat, and illicit cryptocurrency fills the air.

👨‍🍳 Vendor:
🖱️ Donny.exe
An ex-hacker turned meat vendor who claims he's "air-gapped his chakras." He wears a lanyard of expired LAN party badges and breathes through a broken vape mod.

Catchphrases:
“This meat’s been decentralized, baby.”
“You want toppings? I only accept blockchain drizzle.”
“I deep-fried the future and served it with packet loss.”
