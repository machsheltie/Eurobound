Cirque du Shady – Mystery Meat Cart
Location Type: Consumable Vendor (Sketchy Food Items)
Location: Debaucheryville – next to the carnival ringmaster tent

Visuals:
Carnival lights flash violently above a steam-belching pushcart manned by a man in clown shoes and a sleeveless tuxedo. Grease sizzles unnaturally on a neon-lit rotisserie shaped like a carousel. The air smells like burned sugar and something… sinewy. Children cry in the distance.

🎪 Sign:
"SHADE MEAT 4 CLOWN SOULS"
Animated letters glitch between “Shady Dogs,” “Meat Roulette,” and “Free Sample (Not Legally Binding).”
Every 60 seconds, it emits a squeaky clown honk followed by a hiss of steam.

🤡 Theme & Vibe:
A fever dream of carnival grift, forbidden meats, and unlicensed side effects. This cart is where drunk NPCs dare each other to eat and where you make regrettable stat gambles. The entire vibe is “state fair deep-fryer meets darkweb wet market.”

👨‍🍳 Vendor: Chef Chuckles
🃏 Talks in a mix of food puns and veiled threats. Smells like lighter fluid.
He flips sausages with a butterfly knife and insists he used to cater for Cirque du Soleil "before the incident."
Wears a cracked porcelain clown mask during business hours.

Catchphrases:
“Mystery meat builds character... and possibly tumors!”
“Don’t ask what’s in it. Ask what’s not in it. Then cry.”
“One bite and you'll see God. Or a god. Probably a meat one.”
