Claw Machine Maintenance Closet Restroom
Location Type: Restroom
Location: Debaucheryville – Absinthe Arcade – Claw Machine Maintenance Closet

Visuals:
Fluorescent green flicker from an old arcade marquee panel rigged as the only light source
A busted claw machine arm hangs from the ceiling like a cursed chandelier
Exposed wiring snakes across the walls, some sparking faintly when the player passes too close
Mirror above the sink is actually a repurposed CRT arcade screen looping “INSERT COIN”
Graffiti scrawled in highlighter ink, only visible under blacklight
Toilet seat is a modified DDR dance pad, sticky but reactive

Exterior:
Hidden behind a locked maintenance door beside the broken DDR machine
Door unlocks only after inserting 3 tokens
Smudged “MAINTENANCE ONLY” label partially covered by a promo sticker for "XXX PAC-MAN: The Director’s Cut"
Neon reflections bounce off puddles of spilled absinthe and chewed gum

Interior:
Room is barely larger than a mop closet — must rotate awkwardly to shut the door
Janitor bucket now used as a foot soak station by NPC speedrunners
Air is thick with expired citrus cleaner and stale vape
Wall-mounted paper towel dispenser replaced with claw machine prize chute (only dispenses used socks)
Graffiti includes pixelated boobs, fake cheat codes, and a haiku about losing your virginity during a Tekken tourney

Theme and Vibe:
Chaotic retro grime meets early 2000s LAN party afterglow
Feels like stepping into a forbidden backroom of your childhood, now corrupted by adult regret
Echoes of techno music thrum through the thin drywall, sometimes syncing to random sprite flashes

Gameplay Use:
Status Buff:
Grants +1 Embarrassed Resistance if player has ever failed a Quick Time Event in front of an NPC
Lore Hook:
Reading graffiti while Embarrassed unlocks a DDR-themed diary excerpt called “Combo’d by Love”
ICQ Event Trigger:
Option to send the "SMAAAASH" quote to the Rival Trio via ICQ popup after first use
Triggers a 3-turn debuff in their next encounter ("Cringe Lock")
Environmental Cue:
Joystick squeak loop becomes louder the longer you stay in the room
Staying more than 30 seconds triggers a one-liner:
“You’ve achieved nothing but shame, player one.”

Public Restroom Graffiti

Graffiti Bonus
One glowing sticker of a pixel-art arcade joystick with lips appears on the inside stall door
Glows only when the player has the Embarrassed status active
Reading it while Embarrassed unlocks a one-time Lore Drop: “Combo’d by Love”, written in DDR arrow glyphs
Completing all bathroom graffiti while Embarrassed unlocks the title: “Joysticks & Shame”
