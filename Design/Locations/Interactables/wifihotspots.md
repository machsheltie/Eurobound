Wi-Fi Hotspot Mechanics:
Wi-Fi hotspots are marked by an obvious “FREE Wi-Fi” sign outside cafés, bars, and random suspicious storefronts.
Interacting prompts Lord Pilsner to whip out his outdated phone, loading a pixelated ICQ chat interface.
Instead of friendly NPC banter, the connection is “hijacked” by one of the following recurring personalities:

Tony420 – Greasy cyber-dealer offering absurd illicit wares.
Example pop-up: Tony420: "$30 Xanax & Flintstone fentanyl. Message me for my crypto wallet deetz."
Replies include sarcastic brush-offs or gullible acceptance (leads to a gag inventory item like “Fentanyl-Flavored Flintstones Gummies – Non-Edible”).

Hamstradamus – A prophetic dancing hamster with cursed Y2K prophecies.
Example pop-up: Hamstradamus: "REPENT BEFORE THE CLOCK TICKS 00:00 OR YOUR NOKIA SHALL BECOME A TOASTER."
Occasionally references upcoming events in-game in cryptic nonsense form.

CryptoBro69 – An obnoxious pump-and-dump evangelist.
Example pop-up: CryptoBro69: "YOU GOTTA GET IN ON MY PIXELATED KEBAB MONKEY NFT – NEXT STOP, MOON!"
Will shill absurd NFTs that tie directly into the frat bro sidequest.
These pop-ups don’t alter the main plot but add satirical flavor, player choice reactions, and occasional gag inventory items.
