Bulletin Board Crossover System
Borrowing from Earthbound’s bulletin board mechanic, pixelated posters can be found in cities, bars, and random walls.
Location: Scattered throughout all cities, typically in public hubs, side alleys, or near quest areas.
Interaction: Player can press the interact button to read the board. Interacting with a poster displays its full ad text in a pop-up window.
Content Types:
Pixel Posters — Stylized, in-world versions of satirical campaigns (e.g., Got Soap? ads).
Lore Notes — Comedic notices that hint at local rumors, mini-quests, or poke fun at NPCs.
Running Gags — Cross-game callbacks from other Stacey projects.
Reward System: Optional — reading all boards in a city could grant an achievement or unlock a cosmetic (e.g., “Poster Collector” title).
Tone: Retro RPG absurdity meets social satire, in the spirit of Earthbound’s quirky humor.
