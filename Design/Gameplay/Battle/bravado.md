       Bravado System — Full Draft
What is Bravado?
Bravado is the magic system of EuroBound.
It isn’t mystical — it’s fueled by beer muscles, misplaced confidence, and the desperate delusion of men clinging to their past glory.
    • Satirical Core: Bravado explains how our trio can livestream mid-battle, blind enemies with Solo cups, or intimidate bouncers in Prague despite being middle-aged dads.
    • Dynamic Resource: Spent to trigger “signature” moves; lost through failure, embarrassment, or sobriety.
    • Comedic State Machine: Low Bravado visibly changes animations, dialogue, and NPC reactions — they slump, stammer, and lose access to their most ridiculous moves.

The Bravado Economy
    • Spend/Drain:
        ◦ Special moves, Ultimate triggers.
        ◦ Missed attacks.
        ◦ Public embarrassment (slipping on beer, failing pickup lines).
        ◦ Sobriety creep (time passage without drinks).
    • Regen:
        ◦ Compliments from NPCs.
        ◦ Successful flex moments (posing, witty quips).
        ◦ Winning drinking games/minigames.
        ◦ Cheering each other on (party synergy).
    • Statuses:
        ◦ Embarrassed: drains Bravado per turn; disables Ultimate gain.
        ◦ Liquid Confidence: +Crit, +Taunt, but random mis-targets.
        ◦ Hangover: −Speed, −Luck; only cured by Sextuple Espresso or a full rest.

Visual States
    • Low Bravado: slouched posture, weak quips, Ultimate locked out.
    • Mid Bravado: standing tall, moderate quips, can use basics.
    • High Bravado: puffed chest, booming one-liners, special visuals (beer glow, crowd cheering).
    • Zero Bravado: “Dad on a Bender” collapse — dropped animations, forced retreat if not restored.

Regional Bravado Interactions
Publandia (Dublin parody)
    • High: Toasted like war heroes of alcoholism. Strangers buy them rounds.
    • Mid: Blended into “just lads out for a pint.” No fanfare.
    • Low: Booed out of taverns, shamed by children calling them lightweights.
Debaucheryville (Prague parody)
    • High: Treated as chaos gods; casinos comp them, strip clubs give VIP access.
    • Mid: Ignored — just background degenerates.
    • Low: Dragged into “shame parades.” Neon signs flicker insults.
Sinfonia (Vienna parody)
    • High: Every step synced with basslines; treated as nightlife prophets.
    • Mid: Ghostlike in the crowd; neither mocked nor admired.
    • Low: Mistaken for morning people; cafés force them to order decaf.
(Future regions like Berlin/Ibiza can get the same treatment.)

Bravado Spell Schools
Each bro has their own “magic tradition,” with distinct mechanics:
Lord Pilsner — Keg-Fu (drunk boxing chaos)
    • Charm of the Bro Code — Attempt to confuse/charm one enemy; fails hilariously depending on region.
    • Foam Cyclone — Spins beer froth into AoE blind (2 turns).
    • Beer Belly Bash — Belly-first slam; damage + knockback.
    • Ultimate: Mid-Life Crisis — Berserk mode, +crit/+ATK all enemies for 3 turns.
Chadwick — Bro-Mancy (buff/debuff hype magic)
    • Battle Cry of the Mascot — Party-wide ATK/DEF up; minor Speed down.
    • Flash of the Red Solo Cup — Blind enemies with nostalgia flashbacks.
    • Selfie Shield — Creates barrier of fake followers; absorb 1–2 hits.
    • Ultimate: Viral Meltdown — Screams at “haters,” debuffs enemy accuracy, boosts ally morale.
Bradley — Frat-Sorcery (high risk, high reward)
    • Shotgun Ritual — Drinks and hurls can; big damage but self-Bravado drain.
    • Beer Pong Meteor — Precision throw; crit chance scales with Bravado.
    • Alpha Elbow Drop — Wrestling move; hurts both enemy and Bradley.
    • Ultimate: Bouncer Breaker — Stuns all enemies, deals heavy single-target damage.

Regional Spell Variants
Certain spells gain flavor twists per region:
    • Charm of the Bro Code:
        ◦ Dublin: Locals say “what’s a frat?” → spell fizzles.
        ◦ Prague: Enemy joins the party… temporarily.
        ◦ Vienna: NPC lectures about imperialism, delays turn.
    • Battle Cry of the Mascot:
        ◦ Publandia: Crowd sings along, buff doubled.
        ◦ Debaucheryville: Security assumes it’s a riot chant, spawns guards.
        ◦ Sinfonia: Becomes a trance beat, adds Speed buff instead.

Item & Bravado Synergy
Items now interact with Bravado as multipliers:
    • Sets unlock bonuses when archetypes equip matching cringe gear.
        ◦ Bradley + Full Frat Bro Set → Unlocks hidden ultimate: Bros Before Heroes (party-wide shield, drains his Bravado).
        ◦ Chadwick + Influencer Set → Followers “materialize” to auto-taunt enemies.
        ◦ Pilsner + Alumni Set → Gains “Old Glory” passive, regen +Embarrassment resistance.
    • Era Cringe Debuffs: Certain items force disadvantages tied to time period references (JNCO Jeans = inventory slot but slower).
    • Weapon Evolutions: Each bro’s weapon gains new Bravado skills as personal quests advance.
    • Cross-Weapon Combos: Party Bravado synergy triggers satire set-pieces (e.g., “Beer Pong Catapult” where Bradley launches Chadwick).

Personal Quest Chains & Bravado
    • Pilsner: The Holy Keg
        ◦ Bravado powers mythic keg-summoning rituals.
        ◦ Unlocks Final Keg Stand spell (full-party heal + debuff immunity).
    • Chadwick: Viral Redemption
        ◦ Rebuilds fake follower base → unlocks Algorithm Blessing (random buff each turn).
    • Bradley: Bar Champion’s Throne
        ◦ Must win duels; Bravado boosts damage as streak builds.
        ◦ Unlocks Final Roundhouse Slam (heavy AoE).

Why Bravado Works (Satirical Fit)
    1. Thematic Perfection
        ◦ Captures aging frat bros projecting confidence.
        ◦ Comedy emerges when bravado runs out: “I… can’t do the selfie stick combo right now, bro.”
    2. Mechanical Elegance
        ◦ Resource ebb/flow is tied to failures and embarrassments.
        ◦ Strong incentive to roleplay ego-driven decisions.
    3. Storytelling Punch
        ◦ NPC/world reacts differently depending on Bravado level.
        ◦ Signature moves become comedy set-pieces at High Bravado, sad slaps at Low.
