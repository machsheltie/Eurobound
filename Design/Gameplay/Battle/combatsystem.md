Combat System (Fleshed +25%)
Turn Order
    • Base Rule: Standard JRPG initiative, determined by Speed stat.
    • Twist: Bravado levels can artificially inflate speed — e.g., a character on a high Bravado streak acts like they’re “amped” (sugar-rushed frat kid energy), while low Bravado causes sluggish hangover pacing.
    • Environmental Overrides: In regions with strong cultural vibes (Publandia tavern chants, Sinfonia rave basslines), turn order may temporarily sync to NPC/environment beats. Example: all actions in Sinfonia drop in rhythm with the nightclub track.

Action Economy
    • One Main Action: Attack, Skill, or Combo attempt.
    • One Minor Action: Item use, Taunt, Bravado Flex (pose/quip that restores Bravado or tilts enemies).
    • Interrupts / Reactions: Certain Bravado Styles unlock “counter-brags.” Example: If an enemy tries to taunt Bradley, he can interrupt with “Bro, Do You Even Lift?” to gain Bravado instead of losing it.
    • Status Cost: Some statuses alter economy:
        ◦ Embarrassed: Lose minor action.
        ◦ Liquid Confidence: May accidentally spend both actions on the same target (sometimes helpful, sometimes catastrophic).

Combos
    • Trigger Conditions:
        1. Same target (classic setup, two bros pile on).
        2. Compatible skills (pep-talk + slam, keg-throw + fireball, etc.).
        3. Gear triggers (wearing era-accurate cringe gear unlocks absurd synergy moves).
    • Execution:
        1. If both bros declare compatible moves in turn, system prompts for a Combo.
        2. Resolves in turn order (like Chrono Trigger dual/triple techs).
        3. Synergy bonuses scale with current Bravado levels.
    • Success Outcomes: Extra damage, buffs, debuffs, or cultural callbacks.
    • Failure Outcomes (“Backfire Combos”): Mis-timed quips, dropped props, or ego clashes. These result in:
        1. Self-damage (trip, puke, smack teammate).
        2. Bravado drain (crowd boos them).
        3. Embarrassment status (locking Ultimates for a few turns).
    • Combo Categories:
        1. Successful Combos: accidental brilliance.
        2. Bro Code Moves: deliberately dumb but powerful (e.g., “Keg Stand Resurrection” revives an ally).
        3. Competitive Combos: triggered when they try to outdo each other — RNG decides who “wins.”
        4. Backfire Combos: guaranteed comedy when synergy collapses.

Damage & Effect Formulas (Satirical Edge)
    • Base Damage: (ATK + Bravado Modifier) – DEF.
    • Bravado Modifier:
        ◦ High Bravado = bonus damage + ridiculous crit chance.
        ◦ Low Bravado = penalties, with added “Oops” multipliers that increase backfire odds.
    • Status-Based Multipliers:
        ◦ Liquid Confidence: +Crit, −Accuracy.
        ◦ Hangover: −Speed, −Luck, +chance to puke mid-combo.
    • Environmental Multipliers:
        ◦ Publandia: Beer-related moves double in effectiveness.
        ◦ Debaucheryville: Gambling/lust-flavored moves double but 15% chance to “lose control.”
        ◦ Sinfonia: Dance/rhythm moves deal more if timed to the beat.

✨ +25% Improvement Layer:
    • Accessibility Humor Toggle: Players can enable “Narrator Roast Mode” where failed combos trigger rhyming narrator burns (Galavant-style musical dunks).
    • Dynamic Ego Meter: Each bro tracks how much spotlight they’ve had in battle. If one hogs too much (kills, flexes, Ultimates), the others sulk → sabotaging synergy until “placated” (with drinks, praise, or shared gear).
    • Audience/Environment Reactions: Local NPCs literally cheer, boo, or throw peanuts based on combo success, subtly influencing Bravado regen.

G. PERSONALITY-DRIVEN COMBO MODIFIERS 🎭
Pilsner's Delusions of Grandeur

    • Livestream viewer count affects success rate 
    • Can sabotage others' combos for content

COMBO FAILURE RECOVERY SYSTEM 🔄
"Snap Out of It" Mechanic
When combos backfire spectacularly:
    1. Rally Cry (Pilsner): Restores team morale through delusional optimism 
    2. Distraction Post (Chad): Creates viral moment that everyone forgets the failure 
    3. Group Hug (Bradley): Uses bro bond to restore party unity 
Learning from Failure
    • Failed combos unlock "Never Again" passive bonuses 
    • Party develops better timing after multiple failures 
    • Narrator commentary becomes more encouraging (barely) 

ULTIMATE PARTY DYNAMICS 🎯
The system creates emergent storytelling where:
    • Success feels earned and spectacular 
    • Failure is hilarious and character-driven 
    • Competition between bros adds unpredictability 
    • Cooperation requires overcoming their egos 
    • Growth happens through shared embarrassment and triumph 
The magic happens when three walking disasters occasionally achieve accidental greatness... or spectacular failure in equal measure.
