EuroBound: Clout → Spell Unlock Trees
"The more legendary they think they are, the more spectacularly they can fail"
Core Philosophy: Escalating Delusion = Escalating Stakes
Embarrassed status becomes MORE punishing as they level up:
    • Pledge Level: -1 Bravado/turn, can't use Ultimates 
    • Living Legend Level: -3 Bravado/turn, ALL party members lose Bravado (secondhand embarrassment), locked out of combos for 2 turns 
The bigger the ego, the harder the crash.

Embarrassment Escalation
The more "legendary" they become, the more devastating their failures:
    • Living Legend Bradley fails a flex → Entire party loses confidence 
    • Living Legend Chadwick gets ratio'd → All buffs become debuffs for remainder of battle 
    • Living Legend Pilsner tells obviously fake story → Reality briefly glitches 
NPC Reaction Evolution
    • Pledge: "Who are these losers?" 
    • Active: "Oh, college kids..." 
    • Alumni: "Ugh, tourists" 
    • Legacy: "These guys again?" 
    • Living Legend: Either "BOW BEFORE THE LEGENDS" or "Security! SECURITY!" 

Mobile-Optimized Progression Features

Additional Satirical Systems
"Midlife Crisis Mode"
When all three hit Living Legend status, they can trigger a special battle state where they're so delusional they think they're in their 20s again. Massive power boost BUT:
    • All attacks have a 25% chance to "throw out their back" 
    • Bravado drains faster than a punctured keg 
    • Victory dialogue becomes increasingly divorced from reality 
"Reality Check" Boss Mechanics
Certain enemies (like actual college kids or European locals who speak multiple languages) can inflict "Perspective" status that temporarily shows them how ridiculous they look. This debuff:
    • Locks Ultimate abilities 
    • Makes NPCs react with pity instead of fear/respect 
    • Grants bonus EXP when overcome ("Character Growth") 
"Fake It Till You Make It" Passive
At high Clout levels, their delusions become so complete that lies occasionally become true:
    • Pilsner's exaggerated stories have a 5% chance to retroactively unlock bonus loot 
    • Chadwick's fake follower count sometimes manifests actual help 
    • Bradley's "legendary" status occasionally intimidates enemies who've never heard of him 
EarthBound-Style Flavor Text Evolution
As Clout increases, the narrator's descriptions become more elaborate and backhanded:
    • Level 1: "Bradley uses Protein Slam. It's... something." 
    • Level 50: "Bradley performs the ancient ritual of Protein Slam, channeling the spirits of a thousand CrossFit coaches. The enemy is stunned by the sheer audacity." 

The Perfect Balance
This system creates a progression where:
    • Power grows (they become genuinely formidable) 
    • Stakes escalate (failures become more catastrophic) 
    • Comedy amplifies (bigger egos = bigger pratfalls) 
    • Synergy deepens (combo potential expands) 
    • Replayability emerges (different Clout distribution creates different party dynamics) 
The ultimate goal: Create three walking disasters who somehow become accidentally legendary while remaining completely ridiculous.
