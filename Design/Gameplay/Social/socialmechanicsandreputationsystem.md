EuroBound: Social Mechanics & Reputation System
"How Three Walking Disasters Navigate European Nightlife"
Core Philosophy: Shared Catastrophe
The trio's reputation is collective - they're known as "Those Three American Idiots" wherever they go. One bro's disaster becomes everyone's problem, reinforcing their codependent friendship dynamic and creating emergent comedy through shared consequences.
Satirical Foundation: Even their "success" states are backhanded compliments that roast them while providing real mechanical benefits.

    • High Debaucheryville + Low Others = "One-Trick Chaos Artists" (limited to vice districts) 
    • Balanced High Reputation = "International Incidents Waiting to Happen" 

Social Interaction Mechanics
Conversation Trees Based on Reputation:
Each reputation state unlocks different dialogue options, from pathetic groveling to delusional boasting.
Example - Talking to a Bartender:
    • Clueless Tourists: "Do you have American beer?" / "Is this place safe?" / "Can you speak English?" 
    • Legendary Lightweights: "The usual, my good man!" / "Tell them about the Great Keg Incident!" / "Round for the house!" 
Dynamic NPC Reactions:
NPCs remember previous interactions and adjust behavior based on current reputation state.
Reputation-Locked Content:
    • Low States: Access to "learning" opportunities and basic services 
    • Mid States: Normal quest access and social interactions 
    • High States: Exclusive content, unique vendors, special combat scenarios 

Social Combat System
Verbal Sparring Mechanics:
Some encounters resolve through social combat instead of traditional fighting.
Social Battle Actions:
    • Pilsner: "Storytelling" (embellishment vs. credibility) 
    • Chadwick: "Influence Flexing" (fake followers vs. real charisma) 
    • Bradley: "Intimidation" (physical presence vs. actual threat) 
Reputation Modifiers:
Current reputation state affects social combat effectiveness:
    • High reputation = bonus to persuasion attempts 
    • Low reputation = penalties but potential underdog bonuses 
    • Wrong reputation for situation = comedy gold and spectacular failure 

Reputation Recovery/Loss Events
Major Reputation Gains:
    • Accidentally solving local problems

    • Helping locals despite language barriers

    • Milestone celebrations for major reputation changes 

Integration with Other Systems
Combat Integration:
    • Reputation affects crowd behavior during public battles 
    • High reputation = NPC assistance 
    • Low reputation = crowd actively roots against you 
Bravado Synergy:
    • High reputation + High Bravado = Maximum effectiveness 
    • Low reputation + High Bravado = Delusional overconfidence (comedy gold) 
    • Reputation loss can drain Bravado ("But... they loved us yesterday!") 
Equipment Integration:
    • Reputation-locked vendors selling region-specific gear 
    • Social status affects which equipment NPCs react positively to 
    • "Uniform" effects where dressing appropriately for reputation state provides bonuses 
Quest Integration:

    • Failed quests can damage reputation 
    • Successful quests provide reputation boosts and unlock new content 

Satirical Design Principles
Success is Relative:
Even maximum reputation states contain roasts - they're "successful" but still ridiculous.
Failure Can Be Funny:
Low reputation states unlock their own unique content and storylines.
Cultural Commentary:
Each region's reputation system satirizes both American tourist behavior and European stereotypes.
Character Growth:
Reputation changes reflect the bros' (minimal) learning and adaptation.

The Ultimate Social Disaster Experience
This system creates emergent storytelling where three disasters can:
    • Accidentally become beloved local fixtures 
    • Spectacularly fail upward into positions of respect 
    • Create cross-cultural chaos that somehow brings people together 
    • Learn just enough to be dangerous... culturally speaking 
The goal: Make every social interaction a potential comedy goldmine while providing genuine mechanical progression and meaningful player choice.
