Bradley – The Muscle with a Dad Bod
    • Likeable Trait: Genuinely protective of his crew — will charge anyone who threatens them… after catching his breath.
    • Dislikeable Trait: Will pick a fight with anyone over trivial slights. 
    • Battle Role: "Tank/Crowd Controller” Absorbs damage for the party and controls enemy positioning with his pool cue staff's reach advantage. Protective of his friends but gets increasingly reckless as his health drops, triggering berserker-style abilities.
    • Initial Weapon:  Broken Pool Cue Staff
    • Special: Protein Slam — downs a protein shake mid-battle, regaining HP but burping a stun cloud at nearby enemies.
    • Ultimate Move: Bouncer Breaker — rushes enemies like a drunk bull, stunning all for one turn and dealing heavy damage to one. 
    • Motivation: Escape the monotony of his suburban, HOA-ruled life. 
    • Battle Style: "Berserker Protector" Heavy-hitting staff attacks with defensive sweeps to protect allies. Starts combat methodical and defensive, but becomes increasingly aggressive and unpredictable as he takes damage or gets angry. High risk/high reward moves that can either devastate enemy formations or leave him completely exhausted and vulnerable.
    • Quirks: Always looking for the nearest gym or spa; refuses to fight without his “pump-up playlist.”
    • Running Gag: Frequently distracted by gym-related sidequests or flexing competitions with NPCs.
    • Personal Quest: Win a fight in every pub they visit to “reclaim the throne” as the undisputed bar champion. 
    • Bravado Style: Frat-Sorcery — high-risk, high-reward moves that hit like a truck but drain Bravado. 
    • Look: Livestrong bracelet, basketball jersey, baggy jeans. Pagers still clipped “just in case.”
    • Signature Flaw: Only agrees to detours if there’s a gym or protein bar nearby.
