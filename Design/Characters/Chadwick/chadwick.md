Chadwick – The Influencer Nobody Asked For
    • Likeable Trait: Always ready to document friends’ “best” moments, even if those moments are disastrous.
    • Dislikeable Trait: Won’t shut up about his “follower count” (which is clearly fake). 
    • Battle Role: "Support Buffer" Buffs allies through motivational hype and debuffs enemies by making them cringe at his desperate attempts for validation. His ring light mace provides tactical lighting effects and crowd control through blinding attacks.
    • Initial Weapon: Vintage Ring Light Mace
    • Special: Selfie Smite — flash blinds foes, but 10% chance he trips while posting.
    • Ultimate Move: Viral Meltdown — Livestreams the battle while screaming at “haters,” debuffing enemy accuracy and rallying allies. 
    • Motivation: Relive his “viral” moment from 2009 when a dorm prank made the local news. 
    • Battle Style: "Chaotic Support" Focuses on buffing party members while simultaneously trying to create "content" mid-battle. High utility but unreliable - sometimes his attempts to look cool backfire spectacularly. Can blind multiple enemies or boost party morale, but occasionally gets distracted by notifications or trips over his own equipment.
    • Quirks: Keeps stopping mid-combat for “content”; rates every city’s nightlife out of 10, with absurdly shifting criteria.
    • Running Gag: His livestream followers often leave unhelpful or sarcastic “tips” in ICQ chats during missions.
    • Personal Quest: Track down the roommate who took credit for his “greatest post” and reclaim the glory. 
    • Bravado Style: Bro-Mancy — casting support buffs through exaggerated hand signs and motivational yelling. 
    • Look: Trucker hat (backward), popped collar polo, chain wallet. Nokia N-Gage in pocket.
    • Signature Flaw: Rates each city’s nightlife with wildly inconsistent logic, based on how much attention he got that night.
