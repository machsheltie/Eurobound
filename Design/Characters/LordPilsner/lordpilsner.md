Lord Pilsner – The Legend in His Own Mind
    • Likeable Trait: Unshakable optimism — he truly believes the next bar will be “the one.”
    • Dislikeable Trait: Pathological exaggerator — turns minor wins into epic lies. 
    • Battle Role: "Inspiring Commander" Leads the party through sheer delusional confidence and alcohol-fueled bravado. His ceremonial beer paddle commands respect (from himself) while his rallying cries either inspire greatness or secondhand embarrassment. Balances offense and party management through pure narcissistic charisma.
    • Initial Weapon: Ceremonial Beer Paddle
    • Special: Pint-Sized Rally — raises party attack with drunken hype. Sometimes gives enemies secondhand embarrassment, lowering their accuracy.
    • Ultimate Move: Mid-Life Crisis — Tears off his shirt, screams about “still being in his prime,” and goes berserk, hitting all enemies with boosted crit chance for 3 turns.
    • Motivation: Prove to himself (and anyone who will listen) that he’s still “Alpha Sigma material.”
    • Battle Style: "Drunk Boxing Leader" Unpredictable Keg-Fu combat that swings between moments of genuine tactical brilliance and complete chaos. Gets stronger as the battle progresses (building confidence) but also more reckless. Can deliver devastating paddle strikes or inspiring toasts, but occasionally gets distracted by his own "legendary" performance and leaves openings.
    • Quirks: Always insists on ordering “the local specialty” no matter how questionable it looks; has an encyclopedic but often completely inaccurate “knowledge” of European history.
    • Running Gag: Constantly mistakes key plot details, leading to side quests that are either disasters or surprising wins.
    • Personal Quest: Find “The Holy Keg” — a mythical beer tap from his college days that was “totally lost” during a legendary party.
    • Bravado Style: Keg-Fu — drunk boxing with unpredictable swings.
    • Look: Frosted tips, puka shell necklace, cargo shorts. Sidekick phone clipped to his belt.
    • Signature Flaw: Believes every barmaid is seconds away from falling in love with him. She isn’t.
