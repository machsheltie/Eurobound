Public Restroom Graffiti Quest
“Seek wisdom where dignity died.”
Hidden bathrooms have crude/funny graffiti that act as mini lore drops or point to treasure.
Collect all to get the “Street Philosopher” title.

Trigger: Visiting 1 hidden bathroom in each major district across Publandia, Debaucheryville, and Sinfonia
Goal: Find and record all 9 graffiti scrawls
Reward:

Title: Street Philosopher (equips as cosmetic + minor Bravado bonus)
Secret Unlock: ICQ message from CryptoMamiXXX—“You ever stared at stall wall truth until it blinked first?”
Trinket: Dry Marker of Revelation – Can rewrite one NPC’s opinion of you (1x use)
Unlocks the hidden Fistø lore thread and alternate ending flag

🧼 Gameplay Structure:
Each stall has a flickering light, ambient piss echo, and a visible interactable tile tagged with “???”
Upon interaction: graffiti text + optional thought bubble reaction from party
Certain phrases subtly point to hidden stashes or Black Market NPCs
Optional: graffiti lore builds up the legend of an unseen vandal named “Fistø”—tagger/philosopher of the back-alley underworld

Animated Graffiti
Certain scrawls flicker with glitch effects or “drip” briefly before stabilizing.
Some tagged in invisible blacklight ink that only appears when player is under status effect (e.g., Hungover, Embarrassed).

Audio/Whisper Triggers
Hidden ICQ-style whispers (e.g. “you’ve got… shame”) play on proximity or interaction with corrupted tiles.
