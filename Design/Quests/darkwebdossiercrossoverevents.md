Darkweb Dossier Crossover Events
At various points in the game, your party will encounter bizarre, intrusive “communications” from characters out of the Darkweb Dossier universe. These appear primarily via ICQ pop-ups triggered at specific Free Wi-Fi hotspots scattered across the cities.

When an ICQ message comes through, the “Uh-oh! You’ve got a message!” soundbite plays

“I Joined ICQ in 2025 and Was Immediately Added to a Group Chat Called ‘CryptoWives 2.0’”
Spoiler: It was just one dude with 12 sock puppet accounts, and I may have accidentally agreed to host a node.

Want me to help you draft some fake ICQ convos, site screenshots, or Y2K-styled ad parodies for your satire campaign? Because I am 100% ready to go rogue journalist on this.

Fake Chat Logs:

1 That Good Flintstones Sh*t
