The Great Döner Debate (Publandia & Debaucheryville crossover)
NPCs in different cities insist their late-night kebab/döner/kebab-box is the “only real” one.
If you taste-test all variants and give your verdict, you get a “World’s Pickiest Drunk” badge.

The Great Döner Debate

Quest Type: Cross-City Culinary Showdown
Cities: Publandia (Dublin parody) & Debaucheryville (Prague parody)
Trigger: Speak to a drunk NPC outside either kebab location at night
Reward: “World’s Pickiest Drunk” Badge (passive item)
Passive Effect: +1 HP regen when hungover, but random chance of mocking inner monologue line after each bite of food

Quest Premise:

It began with a harmless drunken brag in Publandia:

“That greasy monstrosity in Debaucheryville? Nah bruv, this is real döner.”

But the rivalry runs deeper. National pride. Culinary identity. And way too much garlic sauce.

Your job: taste-test all regional variants, endure the consequences, and give your final verdict via a popup ICQ vote poll. But be warned — someone is always offended. And if you lie? You may just find yourself cursed by the ghost of grease past.

Visuals:
A blinding fluorescent-lit food cart wedged between a chain-link fence and a wall scrawled with “NFT 4 LYFE.” Layers of meat spin languidly on a rusty vertical rotisserie.
Grease puddles shimmer rainbow in the gutter. Empty Red Bull cans and crumpled condom wrappers decorate the sidewalk like confetti. An overturned rave flyer flaps against a crate.
Steam and cigarette smoke hang thick in the cold air. A rat casually gnaws on a rogue chili pepper near the curb.

Vendor:
Mr. Chadz
A bouncer-turned-kebabist. 6’4”, wears a glittery crop top over a bulletproof vest. Runs the stand with one hand while monitoring a burner phone filled with crypto alerts.

“The FDA stopped returning my emails in 2019.”
“Meat’s mostly legal. Heat lamp’s all vibes.”
