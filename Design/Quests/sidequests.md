SideQuests

1 Brewery Tour Sidequest Mechanics:
    • Each European city has 2-3 local breweries to "discover" 
    • Finding them adds their opener to your collection AND unlocks their regional beer as a consumable 
    • Complete a city's brewery tour = unlock that city's "Legendary Hangover" ultimate consumable 
    • Full European brewery tour completion = "Continental Beer Master" achievement that gives permanent +1 to all alcohol-based item effects
