Brewery Tour Sidequest Mechanics:
    • Each European city has 4 local breweries to "discover" for 12 in total
    • Finding them adds their opener to your collection AND unlocks their regional beer as a consumable 
    • Complete a city's brewery tour = unlock that city's "Legendary Hangover" ultimate consumable 
    • Full European brewery tour completion = "Continental Beer Master" achievement that gives permanent +1 to all alcohol-based item effects
    Must acquire the bottle opener keychain in Dublin to unlock and participate in this sidequest

Mechanic: Only accessible if you already picked up the bottle opener keychain in Publandia.

Gameplay: Each brewery is a micro-interior dungeon. Clear an obstacle (yeast monsters, intoxicated tour guides, gimmicky puzzles).

Reward: Unlocks that beer as a consumable (e.g., “Absinthe Lager – restores SP, chance of Confusion”).

City Completion: Unlocks “Legendary Hangover” item (+All stats, inflicts Hungover after battle).

Improvement Layer: Adds “Brewmaster Selfie” collectible at each tour; collect all = passive +1 resistance to Hungover debuff.
