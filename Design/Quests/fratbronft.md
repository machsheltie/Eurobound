Frat Bro NFT Sidequest
Lord Pilsner’s two traveling companions, Chadwick and Bradley, are convinced the secret to legendary hero status is collecting the "Ultimate Brochain NFT Collection" scattered across Europe.

Acquisition Methods:
QR Murals: Graffiti-style street art in back alleys; scanning reveals a garish NFT.
Shady Terminals: Coin-operated kiosks with CRT monitors and sticky keyboards.
Rigged Mini-Games: Win (or intentionally lose) suspicious arcade challenges to “earn” your NFT.
Influencer Syndicate Theft: Occasionally, members of the Influencer Syndicate (smug TikTok travel vloggers with a suspicious number of sponsored posts) will be flaunting an NFT. Defeat them in absurd mini-games or side quests to swipe it.

NFTs:
Debaucheryville Targets:
Velvet Curtain bathroom QR graffiti: "Pixelated Kebab Monkey" NFT– Dubiously hand-drawn in MS Paint.
Rigged Absinthe Arcade claw machine: "Beer Pong Saint Relic" NFT– An 8-bit halo hovering over a red solo cup.
Shadow Exchange ledger backroom: “VIP Wristband PNG” NFT-A flat, over-sharpened PNG of a scuffed velvet wristband, the Photoshop checkerboard still visible, with a fake hologram that flickers “VIP-ish.”

Meme Lord’s First Selfie – Clearly a stolen MySpace photo.

Rewards for Collection Milestones:
3 NFTs: Cosmetic badge displayed on Lord Pilsner’s inventory screen (purely for bragging rights).
6 NFTs: “Wallet of Shame” trinket — a tiny charm granting a small Charisma boost (+1 Charm) but forever marking you as that guy.
9 NFTs: Secret epilogue gag scene where Chadwick & Bradley hold a champagne-fueled press conference as Crypto Kings of Europe… seconds before the market crashes, bankrupting them instantly.

Satire Angle:
NFTs are intentionally ugly, low-res, and paired with ridiculous “lore” explaining their supposed value.
Dialogue pokes fun at crypto hype, get-rich-quick schemes, and frat bro FOMO culture.
