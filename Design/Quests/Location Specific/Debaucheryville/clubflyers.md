Club Flyers

Premise: Paid gig to poster Velvet Curtain + Absinthe Arcade with rival DJ flyers.

Branching:

Honest Promo → Bravado +1, gold reward, minor VIP access.

Slander Campaign → Deface flyers with meme edits; NPCs laugh, rival furious.

Rewards:

Honest: “Club Stamp” consumable (temporary VIP access).

Slander: Trinket “Defaced Flyer” (+1 Charm, +2 Bravado, but random NPCs heckle you).

Improvement Layer: Flyers you post appear physically around the city. Later, NPCs reference them in dialogue → continuity gag.
