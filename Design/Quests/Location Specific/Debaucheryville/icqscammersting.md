ICQ Scammer Sting

Premise: Cyberspace Kavarna hosts scammer threads. NPC asks you to help expose them.

Gameplay: Fake ICQ chat minigame with branching dialogue. Choose sarcastic replies, gullible acceptance, or over-the-top trolling.

Outcomes:

Success = tag scammer’s wallet → reward “Firewall Shades” (+Confusion resist).

Failure = lose gold, but unlock gag inventory “Nigerian Prince’s IOU.”

Improvement Layer: Stings tie into Darkweb Dossier crossover NPCs (Tony420, Hamstradamus). Repeat plays randomize scammer personas → replayability.
