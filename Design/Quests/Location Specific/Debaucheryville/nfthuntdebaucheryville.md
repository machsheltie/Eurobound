NFT Hunt
Premise: Chadwick & Bradley insist “brochain” NFTs = legendary clout.

Debaucheryville Targets:
Velvet Curtain bathroom QR graffiti.
Rigged Absinthe Arcade claw machine.
Shadow Exchange ledger backroom.

NFTs Earned: “Pixelated Kebab Monkey,” “VIP Wristband PNG,” “Beer Pong Saint Relic.”
Satire Bite: Each NFT has absurd MS Paint-quality art + fake lore.

Improvement Layer: Occasionally, an NPC Influencer Syndicate member flaunts an NFT. Beat them in a goofy mini-game (“Lip-Sync Battle,” “Selfie-Off”) to swipe it.
