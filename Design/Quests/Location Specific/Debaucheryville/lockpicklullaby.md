Lockpick Lullaby

Premise: A street musician’s case is stolen into the Old Town “pickpocket maze.”

Gameplay: Overworld puzzle where NPCs shuffle unpredictably. Bumping one can trigger a sleight-of-hand mini-game (lose gold if failed).

Bros’ Quirks:

Bradley can intimidate thieves (low chance to insta-clear).

Chadwick tries “content streaming” → risk of distracting himself and losing more gold.

Pilsner negotiates poorly but might unlock hidden lore NPC lines.

Final Encounter: “Backpack Bard” miniboss (SP-draining AOE busking).

Reward: Return case → “Harmony Harmonica” (cures Confusion). Keep it → unlocks gag skill “Sour Note” (weak AoE, causes Embarrassed).

Improvement Layer: Adds NPC gossip trails hinting who has the case; failing too often earns you the Tourist Trapped debuff (prices higher until cured).
