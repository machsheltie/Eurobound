The Couchsurfing Chronicles
Premise: Meet hostel/bar NPCs who offer a “crash spot.”
Optional interiors where the bros “crash” with NPCs met in bars.
Player must navigate awkward morning-after conversations to get stat boosts (Charisma) or hilariously bad debuffs (Hangover).
1-2 opportunities to crash with NPCs per city

Gameplay: Dialogue mini-scenes the morning after.
Sometimes boost Charisma (“bonding story”).
Sometimes inflict Hangover/Embarrassed debuffs (awkward regrets).
Improvement Layer: Each NPC has unique comic flavor:

“Expat Who Never Left” → overlong rant, gives “Passport Pillow” (+1 Luck).

“Silent Bouncer Poet” → leaves you a cryptic poem (flavor collectible).

“Backpack Bard” → tries to jam at 7am, inflicts -SP but drops music sheet quest item.

Meta Layer (25% Enhancement)
📸 “Morning After Album”

Each unique Couchsurf event adds a “memory photo” to your Crash Gallery (viewable in hostel lobby).

Completing all Couchsurf NPCs across all cities unlocks the title: “Slept Around, Found Out”

Effect: +5% XP from battles only while Hungover 🤣

😬 “One-Night Stand Roulette”

Hidden mechanic: After 3+ Couchsurfings in a single city, you risk triggering a “STI Surprise”

(No graphic content. Instead, you get a status debuff called Regret Rash → reduces Luck for 3 battles, applies minor shame dialogue overlays like “It itches… your dignity.”)

🐸 ICQ Gag Crossover

One random Couchsurf per city unlocks a delayed ICQ pop-up the next day, like:

💬 Missed Call: “Hey, are you the one who clogged the sink?”
💬 New Message: “I’m keeping your hoodie. You don’t get to ghost me.”
💬 Anonymous Tip: “She’s married. Just FYI.”
