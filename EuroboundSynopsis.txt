Eurobound is a satirical, EarthBound-inspired RPG set across three tongue-in-cheek versions of real European cities — Publandia (Dublin), Debaucheryville (Prague), and Sinfonia (Vienna) parody — each exaggerated into caricatures of their most infamous traits.

Players explore pixel-art overworlds, interact with quirky NPCs, and battle over-the-top enemies in a front-view, turn-based combat system that parodies JRPG tropes. Combat features a rolling HP meter, “SMAAAASH!” crits, and status effects like Hungover, Grease Fingers, and Embarrassed.

Some men chase glory.Some men chase dreams.These three? They’re chasing one last blackout before their hairlines and livers finally give up.

Meet Lord Pilsner, Chadwick, and Bradley — three aging frat bro relics who’ve decided that Europe (or as they call it, “EuroBouncin’”) is the perfect place to drink, flirt, and bad-decision their way into “legend” status.They’ve got a mission: Sleep in questionable places, drink in questionable quantities, and experiment with everything a substance loving bro wishes to indulge in. Join them on their journey across Europe as they lurch through the continents' nightlife, seedy underbellies, and cultural hotspots. Each city hides both surface-level charm and a "behind the curtain" underworld of indulgence, vice, and questionable choices.

In their minds, they’re still campus gods. In reality, they’re pushing 40 with beer bellies, outdated tech, and fashion choices that should be crimes in The Hague. But that won’t stop them from swaggering through Publandia, strutting into Debaucheryville, and inevitably waking up in places like Sinfonia without a clue how they got there.

This isn’t about saving the world — it’s about surviving it with your ego intact.The more they win, the more ridiculous they get. The more they lose, the harder you laugh. And somehow… they might just pull it off.

Tone & style: Sharp humor, petty roasts, absurd enemy designs, and a premium touch-friendly iPhone experience. Think EarthBound meets a European party travel guide written by someone with receipts.

Core hooks:

Satirical worldbuilding based on real-world city reputations

Highly stylized pixel art and micro-interaction “juice”

Humor-driven battle skills and items (e.g., Roast Line, Spicy Lip Gloss, Boundaries Card)

Narrative balance of classy European backdrops and gleeful debauchery
