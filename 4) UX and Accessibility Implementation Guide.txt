IMPROVED VERSION (25% Enhancement)

Baseline:
- VoiceOver strings, rotor behaviors, and focus order locked before alpha.
- Dynamic text scaling with font token system; enforce max line length rules.
- High-contrast palettes tested in Sim Daltonism, Coblis, and manual greyscale mode.
- Haptic event map with global toggle and OS-respect.

Enhancements:
- Accessibility onboarding screen at first launch (text size, high-contrast, haptics, reduced motion).
- Automatic safe area and reach-zone adjustments for small vs. Max iPhones.
- Reduced Motion mode disables shakes, rapid animations, and particle clutter.
- Asset export pipeline step: automated colorblind simulation screenshot check before commit.
