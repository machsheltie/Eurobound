Musical Beats (Galavant-Style Softeners)
This file defines the cheeky, satirical musical beats system for EuroBound. These soften transitions, hype Ultimate moves, and occasionally provide sung narration in a Galavant-style parody. Accessibility toggle available for players who want to disable musical interludes.
Victory Stingers
- Short, cheeky chorus lines tied to each map/region.
- Example (Publandia): "Raise your glass, you sorry ass — the pub crawl kings are here!"
- Example (Debaucheryville): "What happens here, stays regretted forever!"
- Example (Sinfonia): "Another night, another wrong note hit!"

Ultimate Choruses
- When an Ultimate fires, a barbershop or club chorus briefly mocks/hypes the move.
- Lord Pilsner — Mid-Life Crisis: "Still got it? He thinks so! Watch him blow!"
- Chadwick — Viral Meltdown: "Like, share, subscribe — to his tears tonight!"
- Bradley — Bouncer Breaker: "One dad bod to crush them all!"
Narrator Verses
- Rare sung narration that punctuates major fails/wins.
- Example Fail: "They thought they were legends… turns out, just has-beens!"
- Example Win: "Against all odds (and common sense), they actually pulled it off!"
- Accessible toggle in audio settings to disable if desired.
