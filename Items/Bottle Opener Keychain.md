Design Notes:
THIS is what our aging frat bros would actually carry! A massive keychain loaded with bottle openers from every brewery, bar, and beach town they've ever been blackout drunk in.
Why This Actually Works:
    • Peak frat bro utility - always ready to crack open a cold one 
    • The jingling creates constant audio cringe 
    • Airport security penalty is hilarious and era-appropriate 
    • Shows their "worldly" experience (aka: places they got wasted) 
    • Multiple brewery logos = trophy collection of their drinking adventures 
Peak Frat Bro Cringe:
    • Weighs down their cargo shorts 
    • Makes noise in every quiet European cathedral 
    • "Dude, I got this one at Señor Frog's!" 
    • Still using it even though twist-offs exist 
    • Each opener tells a story of regrettable decisions

Overworld Interactions:
    • NPC Reactions: European bartenders give you better prices or exclusive drinks because you "clearly know your beer" 
    • Locked Content: Certain pub NPCs won't talk to you unless you have "proper beer credentials" 
    • Cultural Buffs: In Germany/Czech Republic areas, locals treat you with more respect

Enhanced Overworld Interactions:
    • Prague: "Ah, you have Pilsner Urquell opener! You understand REAL beer, not American water!" 
    • Munich: Oktoberfest NPCs treat you like family instead of tourist 
    • Belgium: Trappist monks actually let you into their secret brewery areas 
    • Dublin: Pub crawl guides offer you the "locals only" route 
Plus imagine the party banter:
    • Chadwick: "Bro, remember when we got this one at that sketchy beach bar?" 
    • Bradley: "Dude, that's where you hooked up with that girl with the fake ID!" 
    • Lord Pilsner: "Gentlemen, our European adventure demands we add to this legendary collection!"
