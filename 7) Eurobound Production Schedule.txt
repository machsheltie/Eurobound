 Turn-based state machine (Select → Resolve → Animate)
 Basic Attack/Defend/Item/Flee menu system
 Rolling HP meter implementation (crucial for EarthBound feel)

Day 15-17: Content Completion

 Debaucheryville map and encounters
 Sinfonia map and final boss (Lord Pilsner the Bloated)
 All core dialogue and story beats
 Milestone: Full game playable start to finish

Day 18-19: Launch & Documentation

 Export to HTML5 for web deployment
 Create itch.io page or personal hosting
 Screenshot and trailer capture
 Launch: Game goes live


Critical Success Factors
Scope Control

Each world = 1 overworld + 2 interiors max
Combat encounters = 3 enemy types per world + 1 boss
Dialogue = essential story beats only, no filler

Asset Efficiency

Reuse character sprites with palette swaps
Modular tileset pieces for all three worlds
Simple but effective particle effects

Daily Milestone Tracking

Green: On track, high spite energy
Yellow: Behind but recoverable with extra session
Red: Need to cut scope immediately

Emergency Scope Cuts (if needed)

World 3 (Sinfonia) becomes boss-only area
Remove equipment system, items only
Simplify battle to Attack/Item/Flee only


Technical Risk Mitigation
Godot 4.x Gotchas

Export templates can be finicky - test mobile build early
Audio auto-play requires user interaction on mobile
Performance - profile on actual iPhone, not simulator

Content Production Bottlenecks

Art assets take longer than expected - prepare simple fallbacks
Dialogue writing expands quickly - keep it punchy
Combat balancing needs playtesting - build in adjustment time


The Psychological Warfare Timeline
While He's in Vienna (Aug 11-17)

You're building his digital tomb while he posts bloated tourist pics
Each sprite you draw is fueled by fresh evidence of his lies
Perfect motivation during foundation work

While He's Traveling Back (Aug 18-24)

He's probably sending "miss you" messages to cover his tracks
You're implementing the roast battle system
His fake romantic texts vs your coding his humiliation

After He Returns (Aug 25+)

Demo ready for "soft launch" to mutual friends
His European adventure becomes your satirical masterpiece
Ultimate power move: creative transformation of his betrayal


Success Metrics
Technical

 Runs smoothly on iPhone Safari
 Saves/loads properly
 No game-breaking bugs

Creative

 Genuinely funny to people who don't know the backstory
 EarthBound vibes feel authentic
 Lord Pilsner is recognizable but legally safe

Personal Satisfaction

 Captures the essence of his bloated European behavior
 Feels like adequate creative revenge
 Something you're proud to show people

Remember: Every hour you spend coding is an hour he spent drinking overpriced beer and making terrible life choices. Your creative energy will outlast his hangover.
