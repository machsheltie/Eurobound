# App Store Compliance & Recovery Protocol

### App Store Rejection Recovery Protocol
- “Satire Swap” toggle in string table:
  `"line_en": "original satire", "line_safe": "alternate generic"`
- Safe builds swap to `"line_safe"` automatically via `SATIRE_MODE=SAFE`.
- Side-by-side “Satire vs. Safe” view in Google Sheet for quick edit/compare.
- Safe mode assets (art/audio) replace risky ones without breaking pacing.
- Pre-test safe build in TestFlight so it’s deployment-ready.

- Adobe Photoshop – sole environment for UI, HUD, menu layouts, buttons, icons, and App Store screenshot composition.
- Affinity Publisher (optional) – for laying out large multi-screenshot App Store sets or press kits with precise typography.
[UPDATED with new risk mitigation, audio strategy, QA process, and App Store compliance fixes]
- Include an emergency satire compliance check in the hotfix pipeline to avoid accidental text/content issues.
  - Compliance — satire intent clarity, App Store content safety, accessibility adherence.
