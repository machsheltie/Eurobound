# GAMEPLAN – EuroBound

## 🎮 Core Concept
**EuroBound** is a satirical, retro-style JRPG inspired by EarthBound. It follows three aging frat bros—Lord Pilsner, Chadwick, and Bradley—on a quest to relive their glory days across parody versions of European cities: Publandia (Dublin), Debaucheryville (Prague), and Sinfonia (Vienna). Through pixel-art overworlds, sharp humor, and absurd RPG mechanics, players explore seedy nightlife, oddball NPCs, and laugh-out-loud battles.

## 🗺️ Game Loop
